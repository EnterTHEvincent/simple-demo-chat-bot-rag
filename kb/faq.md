# Tennis Knowledge Base (Modern, Actionable) — FAQ + Playbook

This is a personal tennis knowledge base used to demo a RAG chatbot. The assistant should answer using only the context in these docs.

## How to Use This
When you ask a question, specify:
- singles vs doubles
- your level (UTR/NTRP) if relevant
- the main problem (late, tight, errors long/net, serve, return, nerves, etc.)

If something isn’t covered here, the assistant should ask a clarifying question.

# 1) Levels & Expectations (UTR / NTRP-ish)

## Quick level map (rough, varies by region)
- Beginner: learning contact + basic rally
- UTR 1–3: can rally some, inconsistent under pressure, serve/return shaky
- UTR 3–5: can construct points, still leaks errors on movement/serve/return
- UTR 5–7: patterns + discipline start to matter, weapons emerge
- UTR 7–9: speed + shot tolerance + returns get serious; small mistakes punished
- UTR 9+: high pace, high precision, aggressive returning, strong defense

## What separates levels (the real stuff)
- **Lower levels:** unforced errors decide everything
- **Mid levels:** ability to repeat “safe aggression” + handle pace
- **Higher levels:** returning, first-strike patterns, and defense-to-offense transitions

---

# 2) Foundations (the non-negotiables)

## Split Step (Timing)
- Split step **as the opponent hits** (not after).
- Goal: land as they contact the ball so your first step is explosive.

## Spacing & Contact
- Most errors are **spacing errors**, not “technique.”
- Fix spacing first: earlier prep, more micro-steps, stable head.

## Recovery Position (Simple)
- Recover toward the middle **based on where you hit from**, not a fixed center.
- If you pull them wide, recover less (you’ve already opened the court).

## High Percentage Tennis (Safe Aggression)
- Cross-court is your default.
- Aim **big targets**: deep middle third, heavy cross, body serve.
- Avoid low-percentage winners from neutral or defensive positions.

---

# 3) Error Diagnostics (What to fix when you miss)

## Missing long
Likely causes:
- Too flat contact / not enough topspin
- Late contact (ball already rising past ideal contact)
- Falling backward / weight on heels
Fixes:
- Brush up more (topspin), finish higher
- Earlier prep + earlier contact in front
- Aim deeper middle third instead of lines
- Stop drifting backward (move through the ball)

## Dumping into the net
Likely causes:
- Tight arm, no legs, contact too far back
- Rushing swing under pressure
Fixes:
- Use legs: load → push up
- Increase net clearance (aim 2–3 feet over net)
- More spin, not more force
- Simplify: shorter backswing under pressure

## Shanking wide
Likely causes:
- Late + reaching, or poor spacing
Fixes:
- More micro-steps, don’t “lunge-hit”
- Earlier unit turn
- Hit through the outside of the ball for control

# 4) Point Construction (Singles)

## The default rally pattern (for most players)
1) Deep cross-court until you get a short ball
2) Attack to a big target (usually cross or body)
3) Finish to the open court (or approach + volley)

## When to go down the line (DTL rule)
Go DTL when:
- You are balanced **and** ball is in your strike zone
- You’ve pulled them wide and the court is open
Don’t go DTL when:
- You’re stretched / late / defensive
- You’re trying to “escape” a rally

## Inside-out forehand (core weapon pattern)
- Run around backhand only if you can still recover
- Hit heavy inside-out to pin them
- Mix inside-in only when you’ve earned it (opponent leaning)

## “Neutral is not attack”
If you’re not clearly on offense:
- choose height + depth
- play margin
- don’t force lines

---

# 5) Approaching & Net Play (Singles + Doubles)

## When to approach (green light)
- Short ball you can hit **deep**
- You’ve pushed them back with pace/spin
- You have an approach target (usually cross, deep)
Avoid approaching:
- Off a floating slice that sits up
- Off a weak ball where they’re comfortable passing

## Volley basics (modern)
- “Catch and block” feel — short punch, stable wrist
- Move through the volley, don’t fall away
- Aim middle/deep middle unless finishing is obvious

---

# 6) Doubles (quick modern rules)

## The #1 doubles truth
Doubles is about **taking time away**, not “hitting harder.”

## High-percentage doubles patterns
- Serve T/body + partner poach
- Return cross-court deep middle
- Volley to the middle (reduces angles)
- Attack the weaker volleyer

## Common doubles mistake
Going for “highlight winners” instead of:
- depth + middle
- pressure + repetition
- forcing the error

---

# 7) Serving (Modern Serving Playbook)

## Serve goals by level
- Beginner/low: get it in reliably + consistent toss
- Mid: develop 2nd serve spin + 1st serve placement
- Higher: disguise + patterns + serve +1 execution

## The 3 serve types (simple)
- **Flat:** fastest, lowest margin
- **Slice:** curves away from opponent, pulls them off court
- **Kick/topspin:** jumps up high; best for safe 2nd serve

## Toss rules (serving is a toss skill)
- Most serving problems = toss problems.
- Toss should be consistent height and slightly in front.
- Don’t chase a bad toss — catch it and reset.

## Second serve: non-negotiable
- Hit a spin serve you trust.
- Accept that it may be slower—winning is about starting the point.

## Serve placement (easy targets)
- **Body serve:** great at all levels; jams returners
- **Wide slice:** opens the court
- **T serve:** best surprise + pressure serve

## Serve +1 (serve is not the point)
After serving, plan the next ball:
- Wide slice on deuce → forehand to open court
- Body serve → attack middle / take time away
- Kick to backhand → look for short return

## Serving cues (quick fixes)
- “Loose arm, strong legs”
- “Reach up, not forward”
- “Finish into the court”
- “Brush up for kick, carve for slice”

---

# 8) Returning (Underrated Weapon)

## Return priority order
1) Make the return (no freebies)
2) Return deep (middle/deep middle is fine)
3) Neutralize pace
4) Then get aggressive

## Return positioning
- Step in on slower 2nds
- Give space on big servers to react
- Adjust based on height: kick serve needs more space and higher contact

## Return targets (high percentage)
- Cross-court deep middle
- At the server’s feet if they come in
- Body return if returner is late

---

# 9) Training & Drills (efficient)

## Rally tolerance drill (10 minutes)
- Cross-court only
- Count to 20 clean balls
- If you miss early, restart
Goal: build “don’t miss” muscle.

## Serve ladder (10 minutes)
- 10 serves: body
- 10 serves: wide
- 10 serves: T
Score yourself. Consistency beats speed.

## Pressure drill (simple)
Play points where:
- You only can go DTL after you hit 3 cross-courts
This forces discipline.

---

# 10) Mental Game (modern, practical)

## The reset between points (10 seconds)
- One sentence: what happened (no story)
- One cue: what to do next
- Breath: slow exhale
- Commit: choose the target and go

## “One cue only”
Too many thoughts = tight tennis.
Pick one:
- “Split early”
- “Height + depth”
- “Move your feet”
- “Finish high”
- “Big target”

## Match mindset by level
- Lower: win by **not donating**
- Mid: win by **patterns + margin**
- Higher: win by **returning + first strike + defense**

---

# 11) Quick Troubleshooting (If you feel lost)

## If you’re late
- Earlier split
- Earlier unit turn
- Shorter backswing
- More feet, less arm

## If you’re tight
- Aim bigger targets
- Add spin + height
- Make the next 3 balls
- Stop hunting winners

## If you’re getting pushed around
- Return deeper
- Hit heavier cross
- Use body serves
- Buy time with height

# 12) Demo Guardrails (Assistant Behavior)
- Use only the provided context in this knowledge base.
- If the answer isn’t here, say what’s missing and ask a clarifying question.
- Don’t invent stats, rules, or “certainties” that aren’t in these docs.
- Keep answers concise and actionable, with clear next steps.
